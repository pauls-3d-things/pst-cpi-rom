# PST CPI ROM V0.2

Paul's ROM for the ClockworkPI GameShell based on Debian 11 (Bullseye - Stable), Kernel 5.15 and vanilla RetroArch.

/!\ This ROM is only useful if you have a (3v3) Serial debugger to complete the setup, e.g. to use the serial console to connect to WiFi and then push roms over via ssh. If this does not ring a bell, this ROM will be useless for you! Without WiFi you won't be able to update and use RetroArch!
